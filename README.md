# Project Overview
# Introduction

- The idea of the project came up to me a few weeks before The Game of The Year Awards event. It was my curiosity to see which developers, and publishers are more favorable in the players and consumers eyes. 
- This project was me attempting to implementing what i have learned previously, which includes me scraping the data from an API, clean up the data, explore the data, and visualize the insight i have found inside the data.

# Technology Uses

- Data Scraping: Python, Pandas
- Data Cleaning: Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
- Data Exploratory: SQL
- Data Visualize: Tableau

# Data Sources

- Steamspy API: https://steamspy.com
- Data format:  API data, contain lots of information about all the games on Steam, from the name of the games, id to the review of that particular game.

# Project workflow

- **Forming question**: Asking the questions for data collection
- **Data Collection**: Scraping data and hand pick the column that is related to the questions that had been formed before
- **Data Cleaning**: Removing all text null values and replace all empty number values with algorithmic values for analyzing process
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identified patterns and insights using Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and Tableau.
- **Visualization**: Created dashboards to help emphasize and present the key insights

# Key Insights

- **Valve** is both a publisher and developers, which is reviewed positively by players.
